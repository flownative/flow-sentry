# Sentry integration for Flow 6.x, 7.x and Flow 8.x

This [Flow](https://flow.neos.io) package allows you to automate
reporting of errors to [Sentry](https://www.sentry.io)

## Key Features

This package makes sure that exceptions and errors logged by the Flow 
framework also end up in Sentry. This client takes some extra care to
clean up paths and filenames of stacktraces so you get good overview
while looking at an issue in the Sentry UI.

## Installation

The Sentry integration is installed as a regular Flow package via
Composer. For your existing project, simply include `flownative/sentry`
into the dependencies of your Flow or Neos distribution:

```bash
$ composer require flownative/sentry
```

## Configuration

You need to at least specify a DSN to be used as a logging target. Apart
from that, you can configure the Sentry environment and release. These
options can either be set in the Flow settings or, more conveniently, by
setting the respective environment variables.

```yaml
Flownative:
  Sentry:
    dsn: "%env:SENTRY_DSN%"
    environment: "%env:SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT%"
    release: "%env:SENTRY_RELEASE%"
```

The error sample rate of Sentry can be set using

```yaml
Flownative:
  Sentry:
    sampleRate: 1
```

The default is 1 – 100% percent of all errors are sampled.

Throwables (that includes exceptions and runtime errors) are logged as
Sentry events. You may specify a list of exceptions which should not be
recorded. If such an exception is thrown, it will only be logged as a
"notice".

```yaml
Flownative:
  Sentry:
    capture:
      excludeExceptionTypes:
        - 'Neos\Flow\Mvc\Controller\Exception\InvalidControllerException'
```

If an ignored exception is handled by this Sentry client, it is logged
similar to the following message:

```
… NOTICE Exception 12345: The exception message (Ref: 202004161706040c28ae | Sentry: ignored)
```

## Additional Data

Exceptions declared in an application can optionally implement 
`WithAdditionalDataInterface` provided by this package. If they do, the 
array returned by `getAdditionalData()` will be visible in the "additional 
data" section in Sentry.

Note that the array must only contain values of simple types, such as 
strings, booleans or integers.

## Testing the Client

This package provides a command controller which allows you to log a
test message and a test exception.

Run the following command in your terminal to test your configuration:

```
./flow sentry:test

An informational message was sent to Sentry Event ID: #587abc123457abcd8f873b4212345678

This command will now throw an exception for testing purposes.
